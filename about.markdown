Hi! I'm Giacomo Boscaini-Gilroy and I learnt how to build beautiful and effective charts and maps in the years I've spent working in
 government (Office for National Statistics) and journalism (New Statesman) communicating data and statistics to the public.


Still not sure what I do? Take a look at [my portfolio](https://giacomomakes.art/data). 


Here in this blog I share my tips with you and others who want to know how to marry fun ideas and pretty designs with the technical requirements to code up interactive web graphics.


I'm really glad you've made your way here and if for any reason you want to be in contact I'm easy to find at giacomobg@outlook.com.
