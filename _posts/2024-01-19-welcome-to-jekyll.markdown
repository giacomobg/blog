This is a work in progress post I am writing about how I created my own portfolio.

- I built some basic HTML. I'll add a guide on an approach to starting of with this, but you could just Chat-GPT a first draft.
- I put it in a Github repository
- I used Github pages to publish it. A caveat: It's not guaranteed that this will be free forever, but it has been for a while. I've noticed more and more people hosting work with Netlify or Vercel too.

Done!

To make it more professional

- I bought a domain name from namecheap.com and I updated the CNAME and A records to allow Github to redirect it to my Github pages.
